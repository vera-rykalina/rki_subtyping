# Quick Guide
---

# Important!

> Before you start the pipeline, make absolutely sure that all file names, sequence names, structures of input tables are correct and **follow exactly the patterns** as described in examples.

---

## Pipeline Directory
Locate to `Pipeline` directory:
```sh
$ cd ~/rki_subtyping/Pipeline
```
Open IDE (Visual Code Studio)
```sh
$ code ../
```
---
## Input Folders
Make sure you have 5 directories:

```sh
$ tree  -d
```

```sh
Pipeline/
├── AllSeqsCO20
├── InputFasta
├── Rega
├── Geno2Pheno
├── References
└── Scripts
```

---
## AllSeqsCO20 Folder
Provide this folder with .xlsx files as listed (from HiVpipe): 
```sh
AllSeqsCO20/
├── MS95_Seqs_ENV_CO20_V5.xlsx
├── MS95_Seqs_INT_CO20_V5.xlsx
└── MS95_Seqs_PRRT_CO20_V5.xlsx
```
Refer to Supplementary part of the guide, if you need more information (Page 21).

---
## InputFasta Folder
Provide this folder with files as listed (from HIVpipe): 
```sh
InputFasta/
├── MS95_ENV_20.fasta
├── MS95_INT_20.fasta
└── MS95_PRRT_20.fasta
```
Refer to Supplementary part of the guide, if you need more information (Page 22).

---



## Conda Environment
Activate `hivtype` environment.
```sh
$ conda activate hivtype
```
Be sure you have change in prompt:

```sh
(hivtype) ~/rki_sybtyping/Pipeline$
```
---
## Pipeline with **--outdir** parameter
Parameter `--outdir` determines a name of an ouput folder. The command will generate four enumerated output folders within `Results` folder. Without specifying an output folder you can get a warning message.
```sh
$ nextflow Scripts/hivtype.nf --outdir Results
``` 

---

## Rega Folder (1)
Provide the folder with `.csv` files (separator: comma) generated by [Rega](https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/hiv) using marked `.fasta` files from the folder procuded by the pipeline:

`~/rki_subtyping/Pipeline/Results/1_marked_fasta` 

These `.fasta` files have M at the end of the file name:
```sh
1_marked_fasta/
├── MS95_ENV_20M.fasta
├── MS95_INT_20M.fasta
└── MS95_PRRT_20M.fasta
```
---

## Rega Folder (2)
Rega online tool always generates files with the same name **results**, e.g. `results.csv`. 
Rename these files accordingly, using the pattern as in the example below:

```sh
Rega/
├── Manual_Rega_MS95_ENV_20M.csv
├── Manual_Rega_MS95_INT_20M.csv
└── Manual_Rega_MS95_PRRT_20M.csv
```
Refer to Supplementary part of the guide, if you need more information (Page 23).

---
## Geno2Pheno Folder (1)
Provide the folder with `.csv` files (separator: comma) generated by [Geno2Pheno](https://subtyping.geno2pheno.org/) using marked `.fasta` files from the folder procuded by the pipeline:

`~/rki_subtyping/Pipeline/Results/1_marked_fasta` 

These `.fasta` files have M at the end of the file name:
```sh
1_marked_fasta/
├── MS95_ENV_20M.fasta
├── MS95_INT_20M.fasta
└── MS95_PRRT_20M.fasta
```
---

## Geno2Pheno Folder (2)
Geno2Pheno online tool always generates files with the same name **g2psubtypes_HIV**, e.g. `g2psubtypes_HIV.csv`. 
Rename these files accordingly, using the pattern as in the example below:

```sh
Geno2Pheno/
├── Manual_Geno2Pheno_MS95_ENV_20M.csv
├── Manual_Geno2Pheno_MS95_INT_20M.csv
└── Manual_Geno2Pheno_MS95_PRRT_20M.csv
```
---

## Pipeline with **--full** parameter
Repeat the previous command with `--full` parameter and 
`-resume` flag. The latter allows for generating an output up to `13_mafft` folder. The complete processes are cached.

```sh
$ nextflow Scripts/hivtype.nf --outdir Results --full -resume
```

In the absence of the ENV-related files, also use the parameter **--noenv**
```sh
$ nextflow Scripts/hivtype.nf --outdir Results --noenv --full -resume
```

Check the output of `13_mafft` folder before you run iqtree analysis (msa files - multiple sequence alignments)! 

---
## Pipeline with **--iqtree** parameter
Parameter `--iqtree` allows for running the iqtree process that produces `14_iqtree` folder within `Results`. The folder contains `.iqtree`, `.treefile`, and `.log` files. The parameter can be added at this point, as the last command with report output being produced or not added at all (no `14_iqtree` folder then).

```sh
$ nextflow Scripts/hivtype.nf --outdir Results --full --iqtree -resume
``` 
You can monitor the `.log` file while running iqtree within `work` folder using respective process ID (68), e.g [68/72f0eb]. 

---

## Decision
Manually modify files (see below) which contain `Manual` tag in PRRT_Subpype, INT_Subtype, and ENV_Subtype columns. Save changes and close `.xlsx` files.

```sh
9_joint_with_tags/
├── full_MS95_ENV_20M.xlsx
├── full_MS95_INT_20M.xlsx
└── full_MS95_PRRT_20M.xlsx
```
---
## Report and Plot

```sh
$ nextflow Scripts/hivtype.nf --outdir Results --full --iqtree -resume
``` 

Repeating the command above generates `15_report` folder with `MS95_uploads.xlsx` report file.

Repating it again generates a `MS95_subtype_counts.png` plot and adds it to the `15_report` folder.

---
## Clean Up

Once the pipeline has generated `Results` folder with all desired output files (**save** all needed outputs first), the input files can be removed from the input folders.
```sh
$ rm -rf InputFasta/* AllSeqsCO20/* Rega/* Geno2Pheno/* Results/
```
The same is true for dot and nextflow temp files/folders:
```sh
$ rm -rf .nextflow work .nextflow.log .nextflow.log.*
```

# Notes
---
## Keep in Mind (1)

- for **--rkireport** only
The pipeline does not take into account subsubtypes. If there are subsubtypes they are converted to subtypes. For instance, A1 is converted to A, F2 is converted to F etc.

---
## Keep in Mind (2)
- The pipeline does not perform a full quality check of `.fasta` sequences. Illegal characters should be excluded (the pipeline takes care only of underscores so far). Sequences with illegal characters are not accepted by Rega online tool. 
---

## Keep in Mind (3)
- Make sure that sample names do not exceed 30 characters in length. Long sample names get shorten by Rega online tool that can cause issues. E.g, this sequence name **PK105_F482_23_MiS84_S86_20consensus_PRRT_20** is too long and gets shortern by Rega to **PK105_F482_23_MiS84_S86_20cons**. In such cases a manual change is necessary. 
---

## Keep in Mind (4)
- Be sure you are connected to the Internet

- You can always delete the whole `Results` folder or individual subfolder/subfolders within `Results` and repeat the commnand with `-resume`.
---
